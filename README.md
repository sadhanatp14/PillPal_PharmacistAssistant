#  Pharmacist’s Assistant
An AI-powered system to automate prescription processing and medicine stock matching using OCR and machine learning.

##  Project Overview
Pharmacist’s Assistant is designed to help pharmacists by automating prescription reading and stock matching.  
This system extracts medicine details from **printed prescriptions using OCR (Google Cloud Vision)** and checks for availability in the **pharmacy’s stock database**.  
If a medicine is unavailable, the system **suggests alternative drugs**, making pharmacy operations more efficient.  

##  Key Features
**AI-powered OCR Processing** – Reads and extracts medicine details from prescriptions.  
**Medicine Stock Matching** – Checks availability in the pharmacy database.  
**Alternative Medicine Suggestions** – Recommends substitutes if the prescribed medicine is out of stock.  
**Interactive User Interface** – User-friendly web interface for pharmacists.  
**Secure API & Data Handling** – Protects prescription details with minimal data storage.

## API Endpoints (Flask Backend)
Method     	Endpoint     Description
POST	     /upload	     Uploads a prescription image and extracts medicine details.
GET	     /medicines	     Fetches the list of available medicines in stock.
POST	     /order	       Places an order for a prescription.

## Security & Privacy Considerations
Minimal Data Storage – Only necessary prescription details are processed.
Secure API Access – JWT authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
Role-Based Access – Pharmacists can access and process orders securely.
Prescription Image Handling – Secure uploads with automatic deletion after processing.

## Future Enhancements
Medication Reminders – Notify patients about their medicine schedule.
Pill Recognition – Identify pills using a smartphone camera.
Drug Interaction Alerts – Warn users about harmful medicine combinations.
Secure Medical History Storage – Store and retrieve patient records securely.
Cloud Deployment – Deploy using AWS/GCP/Azure for scalability.
Multi-Language OCR – Support prescriptions in different languages.
